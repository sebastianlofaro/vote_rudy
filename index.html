      <h2>Welcome and thank you for visiting my page,</h2>
      <h3>My name is Rudy Salcedo and I am running for city council position 4.</h3>
      <p>
        As your city council member my goal is to bring back strong integrity, respect into our chambers and reach out to our citizens in the community and not just at community events. I will vote against any higher taxes that are not necessary or uncalled for.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a native resident and I am the roots of the great city of League City.
      </p>

      <p>
        My family has been in League City for over 6 decades. Most of my family was hard working farmers here in town and never in the spotlight.
      </p>
      <p>
        The men that admire the most are no longer here but they are in a better place: like Johnnie Arolfo, RB Canady &amp; Saul Balderas. These men are legends in my eyes and always dreamed of following their footsteps as hard working men in our community. I learned as a young man from those legends about integrity, high ethical standards strong work ethics to build a relationship in the community.

        I married my lovely wife Guadalupe Salcedo, in 1999. We are examples of a hard working class family who emphasized the values of family, faith and fairness. We have a lovely daughter Victoria born with a birth defect and a second child Rudy II. Both kids are talented in science and are in the Clear Creek ISD.
      </p>
      <p>
        My wife and I are both in the medical profession. She is a histocompatibility technologist at UTMB-Galveston and I’m a Histology Technician Specialist at Houston Methodist Hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Graduating from Clear Creek High school, coming from a hard working family class, I went straight into the press room printing local newspaper from League City to Montgomery County. After realizing this was not for me it was time to move on. I attended classes as a Medical assistant at Texas School of Business from there I was hired at Baylor College of medicine. After training, I proceeded my training as a Histology technician training from Baylor College of Medicine.
